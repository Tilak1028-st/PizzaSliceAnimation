3. Build and run the project on the simulator or a physical device.

## How it Works

The pizza slice animation is created using SwiftUI's built-in animation capabilities and custom timing logic.

- **Pizza Slice Animation**: Each slice of the pizza appears with a slight delay, creating the illusion of the pizza being assembled.
- **Scaling Effect**: Once all slices are in place, the entire pizza scales up and then back down for a playful effect.
- **Typewriter Text**: The "The Pizza" text appears letter by letter, simulating a typing effect.

### Key Components:

1. `PizzaView`: Handles the animation of individual pizza slices and the overall scaling effect.
2. `ContentView`: Manages the layout and includes the typewriter text animation for "The Pizza" title.

## Usage in Food Apps

This animation can be easily integrated into various parts of a food app:

- As a loading screen while waiting for order confirmation
- On the menu page when a user selects a pizza
- As a playful animation on the order successful screen

## Customization

You can easily customize the animation by modifying the following:

- Change the pizza slice images in the `Assets` folder
- Adjust animation timings in `PizzaView` and `ContentView`
- Modify the text or font in `ContentView`

## Requirements

- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 12.0+
